Movie Dataset Exploratory Analysis
Introduction
This repository contains an Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) of several movie datasets, which include an SQL database, 2 TSV files, and 2 CSV files. The primary objective of this EDA is to answer three key questions related to the movie industry:

What are the highest grossing film genres that Microsoft can invest in?
What are the best combinations (if any) of the highest grossing films by genre?
Who are the best directors for the job?
In addition to these main questions, a bonus section has been included, showcasing an animated visualization of movie trends since 1980.

Dataset Overview
Data Sources
SQL Database: The SQL database contains a comprehensive collection of movie-related data, including information on genres, directors, box office earnings, and more.
TSV Files: Two TSV (Tab-Separated Values) files were used, presumably containing supplementary data for the analysis.
CSV Files: Two CSV (Comma-Separated Values) files were included, likely containing additional information about movies.
Data Cleaning and Preprocessing
Before conducting the EDA, the datasets underwent cleaning and preprocessing to handle missing values, remove duplicates, and standardize data formats. This step ensures that the analysis is based on reliable and consistent data.

Analysis
1. Highest Grossing Film Genres
To determine the highest grossing film genres that Microsoft can invest in, we performed a thorough analysis of box office earnings across different genres. Key insights and findings regarding the most profitable genres will be detailed in the analysis report.

2. Best Combinations of Highest Grossing Films
We explored whether certain combinations of genres in movies result in higher earnings. This analysis aims to identify potential strategies for creating successful films that appeal to a broad audience.

3. Best Directors for the Job
Identifying the best directors to collaborate with is crucial for Microsoft's success in the movie industry. We evaluated director performance based on box office earnings and other relevant metrics to provide recommendations.

Bonus: Animated Visualization
In the bonus section, we have included an animated visualization that illustrates trends in the movie industry since 1980. This engaging visualization will help viewers gain a deeper understanding of how the industry has evolved over the years.
